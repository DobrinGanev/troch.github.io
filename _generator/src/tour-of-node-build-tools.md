# A tour of Node building tools

In this series of articles, we'll explore popular Node based tools for building web applications.
Although `npm` itself can be used for build automation (see ["How to use npm as a build tool"](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/)),
we will focus on specialised npm packages: `grunt`, `gulp` and `broccoli`. We will try to understand what problems they solve, how to use them
and what their limitations are.

Those tools share a few traits in common:
- They are npm packages exposing an API
- A build file needs to be added to your project `Gruntfile.js`, `gulpfile.js`, `brocfile.js`...
- Plugins (npm packages) wrapping well-known npm packages (uglifyjs, jshint, less, etc...) need to be installed to perform specific tasks
